# Blackjack Project

- Week 4 SD homework assignment **Blackjack Project**

# Description

- Created an application that relies on our use of OO structuring. Working with multiple classes that extend classes. The goal was to create a single player game that allows a Player to play against a Dealer(the program). The player could choose to hit or stand based off their personal gambling principles. The dealer was handcuffed to hit if their cards were below 17 and to stand if above. If the player busts or hits a blackjack then the dealer would not play and would report the appropriate message based off of win or loss. The game could also continue until the cards have run out or a new deck was introduced. 

# Technologies Used

- Eclipse
- Git/Github
- Terminal


# Lessons Learned
- Building the app in a methodical way. Initially bounced around to different sections of classes that I understood. This resulted in unreliable naming conventions and a lot of back and forth between classes.
- Became more comfortable with Enums and how they operate within classes. 
- Working towards understanding how parent classes and child classes interact and where to house information. 
- A lot of logical thinking this time around to make sure the rules of the game were executed efficiently and according to requirements. 
- How abstract methods work.
